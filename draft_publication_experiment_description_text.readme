Provided are as part of the code release the configuration files necessary to run the key model experiments presented in the paper.
The intention is to provide an oppertunity to question the paper assumptions and interpretation through re-analysis,
as well as the creation of new and different experiments. (Plus, to provide a means to replicate published results.)
This readme file details how the experiments can be run.
Refer to the muffin manual:
https://github.com/derpycode/muffindoc
for details on model code installation and configuration, locating and visualizing model results, etc.
