*** FILE GENERATION *******************************************

The sediment model bathymetry is derived from the ETOPO5 dataset, via a re-gridding to an intermediate 1 degree grid.
This 1 degree data is re-gridded to a 36x36 equal area GENIE grid.

The re-gridded bathymetry is then masked with the worbe2 land-sea mask.

The resulting sediment topography file is called:
worbe2.190813.depth.dat
and is displayed in file:
mask_worbe2_ALL.depth.190813.ps

Associated with this is:

(1) A reef mask.
This has been created by firstly identifying all points shallower than 1000 m.
Then, latitudes higher than +- 41.8 N/S (6 most norther and southern bands of latitude) are excluded, 
on the basis that reefal carbonate deposition is predominantly a tropical and sub-tropical process.
The file is: worbe2.190813.reefmask.dat

(2) A templerate (currently blank sediment core save location grid file.)
The file is: worbe2.190813.reefmask.dat

*** REEF CONFIGURATION ****************************************

sg_par_sed_Dmax_neritic=1000.0
sg_par_sed_reef_mask_name="worbe2.190813.reefmask.36x36"

Between them should result in all locations shallower than 1000.0 m being identifed as shallow rather than deep-sea sediments.
The reef mask worbe2.190813.reefmask.36x36 then determines which are 'reef', with the remaining locations shallower than 1000.0 m, 'mud'
(which do not accumulate any carbonate, whether pelagic or neritic).

All locations deeper than 1000.0 m are 'normal' deep-sea sediments.

*** CaCO3 BUDGET **********************************************

The original 36x36x8 sediment model has a global burial rate of about 10 Tmol yr-1.

A generic weathering scheme has:

terrestrial carbonate weathering of ca. 8 CaCO3 Tmol yr-1 (range: 7-12)
terrestrial silicate weathering of ca. 6 Tmol Ca yr-1

for a total of 14 Tmol Ca yr-1.

Hence the long-term steady-state reefla deposition needs to be 4 Tmol CaCO3 yr-1.

To impose a global rate of CaCO3 deposition (4 Tmol yr-1) set

sg_par_sed_CaCO3burialTOT=4E12

*** CONFIG FILES **********************************************

Also included are:

(a) 190813.worbe2.RidgwellHargreaves1997_S36x36.SPIN1
-- the origial 2007 paper closed system experiment as reference

(b) 190813.reef_0Tmol.SPIN
-- the new sediment bathymetry with reefal and mud locations shallower than 1000 
BUT no reefal CaCO3 deposition

(c) 190813.reef_4Tmol.SPIN
-- the new sediment bathymetry with reefal and mud locations shallower than 1000 
WITH no reefal CaCO3 deposition

(a) vs. (b) tests whether global deep-sea CaCO3 is veyr different from originally

(b) vs. (c) tests whether adding reefal deposition locations distorts spatial carbonate chem and hence deep-sea CaCO3 burial

The result is that the new sediment bathymetry grid does a similar job and it does not matter much to deep-sea sediment composition
whether you include reefal deposition or not.
(Remembering that these are closed systems and weathering always balances total global burial regardless of whether additional reefal deposition is selected or not.)
