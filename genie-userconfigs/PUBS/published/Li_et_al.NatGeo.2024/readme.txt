Provided are as part of the code release the configuration files necessary to run the key model experiments presented in the paper.
The intention is to provide an oppertunity to question the paper assumptions and interpretation through re-analysis,
as well as the creation of new and different experiments. (Plus, to provide a means to replicate published results.)
This readme file details how the experiments can be run.
Refer to the muffin manual:
https://github.com/derpycode/muffindoc
for details on model code installation and configuration, locating and visualizing model results, etc.

RUNNING THE EXPERIMENTS PLUS FURTHER DETAILS
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The different dirctories of user-config files need to be unpacked before any ensemble experiments can be run.
For example, for ensemble ML.petm016:
tar xzf ML.petm016.tar.gz

Also -- in addition to unpacking the archive file containing forcing definition folders (genie-forcings.copyme.tar.gz)
the individual forcings folders inside genie-forcings.copyme MUST be copied to the genie-forcings directory of your model installation.
These are required by both the ML.petm038.ID.* AND ML.petm043.ID.* ensembles.

Name:	p0055c.Lietal2020.3pal.SPIN1

Note:	The initial spin-up phase, where the ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle is set to 'closed.' Global weathering fluxes are balanced with the sedimentary burial of CaCO3, and bioturbation is disabled in sediments. The model starts from a 'cold' state, with uniform temperature and salinity in the ocean, and uniform temperature and humidity in the atmosphere. All biogeochemical tracers are initialized with uniform concentrations, and deep-ocean sediments lack biogenic material. Alkalinity is set to 1975 μmol eq/kg, yielding a mean global CaCO3 content of approximately 47%. Although the final ensemble does not rely on this prescribed alkalinity, the phase is run with pCO2 fixed at 834 ppm and δ13C at -4.9%. The model runs for 20 kyr, reaching steady state by the end.

To run:
./runmuffin.sh cgenie.eb_go_gs_ac_bg_sg_rg_gl.p0055c.BASES PUBS/published/Li_et_al.NatGeo.2024 p0055c.Lietal2020.3pal.SPIN1 20000

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Name:	p0055c.Lietal2020.3pal.SPIN2gl

Note:	The second phase transitions to an 'open' system, enabling temperature-controlled carbonate and silicate weathering, with evolving pCO2 and δ13C values. Bioturbation is enabled in surface sediments. This phase runs for 200 kyr, with an acceleration ratio of 1:9 (10 years of model time for every 100 years of simulation), and pCO2 drifts within 2 ppm over 200 kyr.

To run:

Name:	ML.petm016
By:	Mingsong Li
Date:	May 20, 2020
Detail:	
	60-member ensemble
	2 myr open system run
Comment:
	This ensemble investigates state-dependent climate sensitivity, where climate sensitivity varies with pCO2. It explores two variables: (1) volcanic outgassing rates (0.6 to 2.4 times the baseline rate of 7.24 × 10¹² mol C/yr in increments of 0.2) and (2) a climate feedback parameter (λ) for pCO2 doubling (ΔF2x). The ΔF2x/λ ratio (τ) is varied from 2.88 to 17.31, covering a range of radiative forcing. With the system set to ‘open’ and bioturbation enabled, each experiment undergoes a 2 million year run to a new steady state, using an acceleration ratio of 1:90 (10 years of model run per every 1000 years of simulation).
